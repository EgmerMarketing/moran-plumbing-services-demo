## Script

### INTRO (15 seconds)
*[Camera on, friendly face]*

> "Hey! Quick video for the team at Moran Plumbing. I was researching Phoenix plumbers and came across your site — noticed a couple things I thought you'd want to know about."

*[Transition to screen share]*

---

### SHOW THE PROBLEM (30-45 seconds)
*[Screen share: their website]*

> "So here's your site — the homepage looks good, I like the branding. But watch what happens when I go to your Services page..."

*[Navigate to moranplumbingservices.com/our-services]*

> "This is your Services page. And it's got... Carpentry. Painting. Electrical. You guys are plumbers, right?"

*[Scroll to show the placeholder text]*

> "And all this text — 'I'm a paragraph. Click here to add your own text' — that's the default Wix template. It was never filled in."

*[Pause briefly to let it sink in]*

> "If someone's checking you out — maybe they saw your truck, or got a referral — and they click Services, they see this. It doesn't exactly build confidence."

---

### SHOW THE SOLUTION (60-90 seconds)
*[Switch to demo site tab]*

> "So I actually put together a quick demo of what your site could look like — same branding, same vibe, just... working."

*[Show homepage]*

> "Homepage with your services front and center. Clear phone number, clear call to action."

*[Click to About page]*

> "About page actually loads — tells your story. Family-owned, serving Arizona, all that good stuff."

*[Click to Services]*

> "Services page with all your offerings — residential, commercial, new construction, water heaters. Each one has its own page for SEO."

*[Click to a Location page]*

> "And location pages for each city you serve — Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe, Glendale. This helps you show up when someone searches 'plumber near me' in those areas."

*[Quick scroll through blog if time]*

> "Even has a blog with articles about Arizona plumbing — hard water, water heaters, stuff your customers are actually searching for."

---

### SOFT CLOSE (20-30 seconds)
*[Back to camera or stay on screen share]*

> "Anyway — I'm not trying to sell you anything. Just thought you'd want to know about those broken pages. 

> The demo is yours to look at — I'll drop the link in the email. If you want to chat about making something like this happen, I'm happy to. If not, no worries — at least get someone to fix those 404s.

> Alright, that's it. Hope this was helpful. Take care!"

*[End recording]*

## Key Points to Hit

✅ **Lead with THEIR problem** (not your services)
✅ **Show don't tell** — click the broken pages live
✅ **Demo is concrete** — not "we could do this" but "here it is"
✅ **No pressure** — explicitly say no obligation
✅ **Give them an easy out** — "at least fix those 404s"
✅ **Keep it SHORT** — respect their time

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't ramble about your company or services
❌ Don't use marketing jargon ("ROI", "conversion optimization")
❌ Don't pressure them to book a call
❌ Don't criticize their current site beyond the broken pages
❌ Don't make it longer than 3 minutes
❌ Don't sound scripted — be conversational

---
