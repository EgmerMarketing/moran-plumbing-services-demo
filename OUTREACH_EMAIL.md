# Outreach Email Options for Moran Plumbing Services

## Context
Their current website has VISIBLE problems:
- **/our-services page has PLACEHOLDER CONTENT** — literally says "I'm a paragraph. Click here to add your own text"
- **Lists wrong services** — Carpentry, Painting, Electrical (they're PLUMBERS!)
- **Nav links don't go to separate pages** — Services and About just reload homepage
- **Footer says "© 2035 by The Handy Gang"** — template never customized
- **Single-page site** — no SEO value from dedicated pages

This isn't a cold pitch for web design services. This is pointing out a real problem they likely don't know about, with a concrete solution to show them.

## Option 1: Direct & Short (Recommended)

**Subject:** Quick heads up about your website

**Body:**

Hi there,

I was looking up plumbers in the Phoenix area and came across Moran Plumbing Services. Noticed something on your site you might not be aware of — your Services page (/our-services) still has placeholder text from the Wix template.

It lists "Carpentry," "Painting," and "Electrical" as services with the default "I'm a paragraph. Click here to add your own text" content. Since you're a plumbing company, that might confuse potential customers.

I work in web design and built out a quick demo of what a refreshed site could look like — same branding, real content for your actual services:

No pitch, no obligation — just thought you'd want to know. If the demo is helpful or you have questions, happy to chat.

Best,

## Option 2: Slightly Warmer (If You've Engaged on Social First)

**Subject:** Re: Your Instagram post (+ a heads up)

**Body:**

Hey!

Saw your post about the water heater install — nice work. Family businesses like yours are the backbone of Phoenix.

Quick heads up: I was checking out your website and noticed a couple pages are broken (About and Services both 404). Wanted to let you know since potential customers might be hitting dead ends.

I actually put together a quick demo of what a refreshed site could look like — same Moran branding, just everything working:

[DEMO LINK]

No strings attached. Just figured you'd want to know about those broken links either way.

If you ever want to talk websites, I'm around.

## Option 3: Loom Video Approach (Highest Effort, Highest Conversion)

**Subject:** Quick video about your website (2 min)

**Body:**

Hi,

I put together a quick 2-minute video showing some issues I found on your website + a demo I built:

[LOOM LINK]

TL;DW version:
- Your About page and Services page are both broken (404 errors)
- Built a demo showing what a working version could look like
- No pitch — just thought you should see it

Let me know if you have questions.

## What to Include in the Loom Video

If you go the Loom route:

1. **Show the problem (30 sec)**
   - Screen share their site
   - Click About → 404
   - Click Services → 404
   - "This is what your potential customers are seeing..."

2. **Show the solution (60 sec)**
   - Switch to the demo site
   - Walk through homepage, services, locations
   - "Here's what it could look like..."

3. **Soft close (30 sec)**
   - "No pressure — just thought you'd want to know about the broken pages"
   - "If you have questions, happy to chat"
   - "Contact info in the email"

---

## Why This Works

1. **You're leading with VALUE**, not a sales pitch
2. **The problem is REAL and VERIFIABLE** — they can check themselves
3. **The demo is CONCRETE** — not "we could help you" but "here's what it looks like"
4. **Low pressure** — you're explicitly saying no obligation
5. **It's HELPFUL** even if they don't hire you

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

If no response in 5-7 days, ONE follow-up:

**Subject:** Re: Quick heads up about your website

**Body:**

Just bumping this in case it got buried. Those broken pages are still showing 404 errors if you want to have your current web person take a look.

Either way, hope business is going well.

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't send multiple follow-ups
❌ Don't add them to an email list
❌ Don't pitch other services in the initial email
❌ Don't use "I'd love to hop on a quick call" language
❌ Don't be salesy or use marketing speak
❌ Don't promise results you can't guarantee

---

## Alternative: Instagram DM First

If email feels too cold, try warming up on Instagram first:

1. Follow @moranplumbingservices
2. Like/comment genuinely on 2-3 posts over a week
3. Then DM:

**DM:**
"Hey! Came across your page looking for Phoenix plumbers. Quick heads up — noticed your About and Services pages on the website are throwing 404 errors. Might want to have someone check that out. Cheers!"

If they respond positively, THEN mention:
"I actually work in web design and put together a quick demo showing what a cleaner version could look like if you're interested in seeing it. No pitch — happy to share the link."

---

## Key Principle

**You're not selling web design. You're helping a local business owner discover a problem — and showing them what a solution looks like.**

If they want to work together, great. If they take the ideas and have someone else build it, that's fine too. Either way, you've made a genuine connection and demonstrated expertise.
