# Instagram Warm-Up Sequence — Moran Plumbing

**Goal:** Build familiarity before pitching. Move from stranger → familiar face → helpful connection → potential client.

**Timeline:** 5-7 days minimum before DM outreach
**Account to use:** Egmer Marketing or personal (whichever feels more authentic)

---

## Phase 1: Follow & Engage (Days 1-3)

### Day 1
- **Follow** @moranplumbingservices
- **Like** their most recent post
- **No comment yet** — just establishing presence

### Day 2
- **Like** 2-3 of their older posts (scroll back)
- **Leave ONE genuine comment** on a post that deserves it

**Good comment targets:**
- Job completion photos → "Clean work! 🔥"
- Team photos → "Love seeing family businesses thrive 💪"
- Before/after shots → "That's a transformation right there"
- Water heater installs → "Tankless for the win"

**Comment rules:**
- Keep it SHORT (3-7 words)
- Be genuine — only comment if you actually mean it
- Use ONE emoji max
- Don't mention your business
- Don't ask questions yet

### Day 3
- **Like** their Story if they post one
- **Like** 1-2 more posts
- **Optional:** Leave another short comment if something genuinely catches your eye

---

## Phase 2: Build Recognition (Days 4-5)

### Day 4
- **Comment on a new post** (if they post)
- This time, slightly more engaged:
  - "That's the kind of work that gets referrals"
  - "North Phoenix represent 🙌"
  - "24/7 is no joke — respect"

### Day 5
- **Like** their Story again (if posted)
- **React to a Story** with an emoji if there's something good
- They should start recognizing your name by now

---

## Phase 3: The DM (Days 6-7)

### Day 6 or 7 — Send the First DM

**Option A: Pure Value (No Ask)**

> Hey! Been following along — love seeing a family business doing it right in Phoenix.
> 
> Quick heads up: noticed your website's Services page (/our-services) still has the Wix template placeholder text. It lists Carpentry and Painting as services with "Click here to add your own text" — might want to either fill that in or take it down since you're plumbers not painters 😅
> 
> Cheers! 🤙

**Wait for response.** If they reply positively (thanks, didn't know, etc.), THEN follow up.

---

### If They Respond Positively — Follow-Up DM

**Option B: Offer the Demo**

> Happy to help! I actually work in web design and put together a quick demo of what a refreshed site could look like — same Moran branding, just everything working.
> 
> No pressure at all — just figured I'd offer since I already built it out. Want me to send the link?

**If they say yes:** Send demo link + your email for follow-up
**If they don't respond:** Leave it. Don't double-message.

---

## Alternative: The Warmer DM (If You've Built More Rapport)

After 7+ days of engagement, if they've responded to comments or liked your stuff back:

> Hey! Real quick — I was looking at your website and noticed the About and Services pages are broken (404 errors). Figured you'd want to know.
>
> I work in web design and actually put together a demo of what a fixed-up version could look like. Same branding, just cleaner + SEO optimized. Happy to share if you're curious — no strings attached.

---

## DM Rules

✅ **DO:**
- Keep it short (under 100 words first message)
- Lead with value (the broken pages)
- Make it easy to say no
- Be patient — wait for response before pitching
- Use their casual tone (they're not corporate)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Send a wall of text
- Pitch your services in the first message
- Send multiple DMs if no response
- Use marketing speak
- Be pushy or "follow up" aggressively
- Mention pricing or packages

---

## If No Response After 5-7 Days

**ONE gentle follow-up max:**

> Hey, just bumping this in case it got buried. Those pages are still showing errors if you want to have your web person take a look. Either way, hope business is booming! 🙌

**Then STOP.** If they don't respond to two messages, they're not interested. Move on.

## Tracking

Keep notes:
- [ ] Day 1: Followed, liked 1 post
- [ ] Day 2: Liked 2-3 posts, left comment on [post]
- [ ] Day 3: Liked story, liked posts
- [ ] Day 4: Comment on [post]
- [ ] Day 5: Story reaction
- [ ] Day 6/7: Sent DM
- [ ] Response: [yes/no/pending]
- [ ] Follow-up sent: [date]
- [ ] Outcome: [?]

---

## Why This Works

1. **You're not a stranger** — they've seen your name for a week
2. **You've given before asking** — genuine engagement first
3. **The problem is real** — they can verify the 404s themselves
4. **Low pressure** — you're offering help, not selling
5. **Easy next step** — just "want me to send the link?"
